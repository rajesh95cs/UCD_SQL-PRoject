UCD SQL Project
This project was developed as part of the UCD Professional Academy Diploma in Database Fundamentals. It showcases advanced SQL queries and techniques applied to an academic database, with a focus on analyzing and managing data related to students, professors, courses, and departments.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in SQL through a series of complex queries that address real-world data challenges in the context of higher education. Each query solves a specific problem, such as identifying professors in small departments, calculating average GPAs for course sections, and analyzing student enrollment data.

Key Features
Advanced SQL Queries: Uses complex SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data across multiple tables.
Joins and Aggregations: Includes inner joins, groupings, and aggregations to compute statistics such as average GPA, student counts, and department course offerings.
Subqueries and Conditional Logic: Implements nested subqueries and NOT EXISTS clauses to address more complex filtering and selection logic.
Data Filtering: Queries filter data based on criteria like GPA, age, course enrollment, and department size to answer specific questions about academic data.
Skills Demonstrated
Proficiency in SQL for querying relational databases.
Experience with JOIN operations, GROUP BY clauses, and aggregate functions like COUNT(), AVG(), and MIN().
Effective use of subqueries and conditional logic for complex problem-solving.
Ability to analyze and manipulate academic data for reporting and insights.
Example Queries
Professors in Small Departments: Find the names of professors working in departments with fewer than 50 PhD students.
Lowest GPA Students: Identify students with the lowest GPA across all departments.
Course Section Statistics: Calculate the average GPA for each section of Computer Science courses.


Getting Started
